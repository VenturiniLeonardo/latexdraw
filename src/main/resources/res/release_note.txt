Version 4.0.1 -- 2020-04-13

- fix: the app does not start with a OS language not supported
- fix/change: instead of requiring the tool ImageMagick to convert pdd to png thumbnails,
  the app now uses pdftoppm, which is provided by LaTeX distributions
- fix: export using LaTeX does not work on Windows
- fix: the LaTeX 'text position' had no graphical effect
- fix: issues in translation files
- fix: the app may not stop correctly
- fix: some actions do not work on start because of an configuration issue
- fix: Windows prevents parallel LaTeX compilations (this had an impact on the text rendering that may fail)
- translations updated
- no more export using pdfcrop as the exported pdf files should now be cropped natively
